# Sep22-TO DO LIST

Project to create a simple To Do List. 

ðŸ”— **Live preview:** [here]()

## Built with
* HTML
* CSS
* SCSS
* JS

### Tools

* Visual Studio Code
* MacOS terminal
* Git and GitHub



## Outcome

* Used HTML5 for better readability and structure with SCSS by structuring class names in HTML.
* Tried to maintain **clean code**.
* **Cross tested** on Firefox and Chromium based browsers.

## Summary

### What I learned

* Gained a better understanding of how to grab value from input field and append that data to a container using DOM manipulation.
* Learned how to apply an error message under the input field if there is no value entered into list. Then I went through a long phase of debugging to figure out how to remove the "Please enter an item error" if the user enters an item the first time, then enteres no value but clicks the "remove" button on the first item, the error would stay listed.
* Definitely improved in the media query section, but need more work in this area. It was just a simple query to resize the conotainer width whenever the window shrinks or grows.
